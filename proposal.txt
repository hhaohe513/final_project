-	Substantive question:
Do people with sleeping disorder tend to have higher blood pressures?

-	Specific data sets and variables I will use:
1. 2017-2018 NHANES Demographic data:
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/DEMO_J.XPT
Variables of interest:
SEQN:id
RIDSTATR: status
WTMEC2YR: MEC exam weight

2. 2017-2018 NHANES sleep disorder data:
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/SLQ_J.XPT
Variables of interest:
SEQN:id
SLD012:weekday sleep hours
SLD013:weekend sleep hours
SLQ050:ever told doctor had trouble sleeping
SLQ120:how often fell overly sleepy during day

3.2017-2018 NHANES blood pressure data:
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/BPX_J.XPT
Variables of interest:
SEQN:id
BPXSY1:Systolic Blood Presure 1st measurement
BPXSY2:Systolic Blood Presure 2nd measurement
BPXSY3:Systolic Blood Presure 3rd measurement
BPXDI1:Diastolic Blood Presure 1st measurement
BPXDI2:Diastolic Blood Presure 2nd measurement
BPXDI3:Diastolic Blood Presure 3rd measurement

-	Plan for analysis:

1. First create a binary indicator variable is_disorder using SLD012,
SLD013, SLQ050 and SDQ120 in the sleep disorder data.
2. Create variable BPXSY as average of BPXSY1-BPXSY3, and BPXDI as average
of BPXDI1-BPXDI3.
3. Filter observations with status not equal to 2 in demographic data.
4. Provide point estimate and confidence interval for BPXSY and BPXDI 
for people with or without sleep disorder using survey weight.
5. Provide point estimate and confidence interval for difference between
people with or without sleep disorder for BPXSY and BPXDI and check whether
0 is included in the confidence interval to draw conclusion.
